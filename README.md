## [Pick Locks](https://gfycat.com/HandmadeOrneryCranefly)

### There are two ways to be able to pick a lock:
1. Have the burglar profession.
  Burglars have a speed bonus to pick locks.
2. Read "The Burglar's Magazine"
  This magazine also teaches you to make paperclips using a [Wire](http://www.aggressivegaming.org/newdawn/wiki/item.php?Name=Wire) and a [Can Opener](http://www.aggressivegaming.org/newdawn/wiki/item.php?Name=TinOpener)/[Kitchen Knife](http://www.aggressivegaming.org/newdawn/wiki/item.php?Name=KitchenKnife)/[Hunting Knife](http://www.aggressivegaming.org/newdawn/wiki/item.php?Name=HuntingKnife).

You also need a [Screwdriver](http://www.aggressivegaming.org/newdawn/wiki/item.php?Name=Screwdriver) and at least one [Paperclip](http://www.aggressivegaming.org/newdawn/wiki/item.php?Name=Paperclip) to pick locks.

Lockpicking uses the LightFooted skill. If the skill is at level 0, there's a 10% chance that the [Paperclip](http://www.aggressivegaming.org/newdawn/wiki/item.php?Name=Paperclip) will break before successfully unlocking a door. For players with a LightFooted level less than 8, there's a 20% chance that the [Paperclip](http://www.aggressivegaming.org/newdawn/wiki/item.php?Name=Paperclip) will break AFTER unlocking a door.
